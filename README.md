## Colors

For the Taskosaurus App I decided to use a monochromatic color scheme because these color schemes often look clean and professional. Variations of a bluish-green were the decided on colors because blue is often used for tech websites (think Facebook or Twitter) and green is pleasing to the eye. An orange color was also used to indicate when a task was overdue but incomplete and orange was chosen because of its good contrast with the other colors. Here are the hex values of the colors that I used:

- #277A54 - For darker shades such as borders
- #9BFBCE - For lighter shades 
- #50FAAB - For medium shades and background colors
- #FB7F00 - For the orange warning colors.
- #FFFFFF - White color to make the other colors stand out/ text
- #000000 - black color to make the other colors stand out/ text due to contrast with the white color.

## Wireframes


## Typography
Montserrat and Lato were imported from Google Fonts to be used in this project.

Montserrat - Chosen for generic headers and larger text and for its legibility.
Lato - Chose to contrast with Montserrat for the smaller paragraph-style texts. Also has good legibility.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
